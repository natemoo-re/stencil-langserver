# Stencil Language Server

The Stencil Language Server (SLS) is built upon the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md). It enables anyone to add support for [Stencil](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil) projects in their favorite editor.

## Features
- Context-aware completions
- Decorators
	- Component Lifecycle Methods
	- Component Methods (`hostData`, `render`)
	- `@Watch(...props)`
	- `@Listen(...events)`
- Document Links

To enable these features in your editor, you can install one of the extensions below (or build your own!)
